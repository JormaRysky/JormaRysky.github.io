            <p>It's august and it's time to harvest the crop.</p>
            <p>Too bad your teeth fell off back in 1985, so you are stuck hunting with only your trusty and rusty sickle.</p>
            <p>Your goal is to hunt every living thing inside the level and go back to sleep inside your cozy coffin. Beware of lighted spaces as you are allergic to light.</p>
            <p>Also did we forget to tell you are 4th dimensional being too. While for humans it looks like magic, as a higher dimensional being you know it is not all blessing.
            You are always hearing call of the void, empty, black, lifeless (in different way than you) void. It is surrounding you everywhere you go, you are stuck in 4 dimensions like humans are in three.

            <h3>Enter the Elonkorjuu 2</h3>

            <p>During post jam period we thought about making full game out of "EK-LH". However after taking hiatus from development, we realized base is too rough and limited for full scale production.
            We also pretty much did everything we could with gameplay formula, all the new additions to it (which you can only enable with Post Jam-builds level editor) made core formula weaker and jankier.</p>

            <p>So let's scrap it all and build new game in Bevy (Not in Godot as we originally announced.)</p>

            <p>Bevy being interfaceless game engine, we are not going to run into limits of content loading outside of build, cause -EVERYTHING- is loaded outside by default.
                 This means all graphics, no matter if they are 2D, 3D or fonts can be replaced without much effort. Also level format is our own propiertary, so no problems with that either.
                 This is ideal for Total Conversion-mods.</p>

            <p>Most of the (charming, but well... limiting) limits have stripped from graphics creation. We employed very strict rules for EK-LH that enabled me to create stylistically cohesive,
                 fully 3D game in those short 72 hours. For example all planes were aligned in 90-degree rotations. There was no billboarding sprites. All level elements were built with 2m x 2m grid in mind.
                 There were no lighting of any kind.
                
            <p>And while these rules were part of what made ''EK - LH'' what it is, for full fledged game I'd rather go for more fidelity. Keep all the good, characteristics aspects (1-bit colours, stop motion animations)
                and strip those away that only add to clunkyness.</p>

            <p>Same with gameplay. For ''Wolfenstein 3D'' style gameplay of ''EK - LH'' vertical camera lock and lack of jump worked well. 
                However those were first things we got rid of when we started putting together idea for ''EK2''</p>
